"""The minimal T2RModel interface required by T2R infrastructure.

# TODO(T2R_CONTRIBUTORS): Sunset this interface in favor of AbstractT2RModel.
This is a proper interface used by T2R infrastructure such as train_eval,
input_generators, preprocessors, exporters, predictors.

For T2R model development it is highly recommended to inherit from any of the
abstract, classification, critic or regresssion model. These model abstractions
contain our best practices to write composable models by introducing additional
abstractions and re-usable functionality such as inference_network_fn and
model_train_fn etc.
